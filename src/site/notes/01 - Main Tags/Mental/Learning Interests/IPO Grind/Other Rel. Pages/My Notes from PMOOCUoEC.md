According to DW (Dave Ward), philosophy is simply the activity philosophers do. It’s an **activity**, that we have to engage in, not just a subject. You must not just listen, but to think about everything deeply.  
It is the activity of working out the best way of thinking about things. 
That begs the question, don’t all subjects try to do just that? Aren’t they all trying to make us look at the world through their specially tinted lenses? How does this differ from philosophy?

Well, take physics. When we do physics, we collect data, design experiments and try to figure out how we can explain a phenomena in the most general manner possible. But take a step back. Now let’s consider questions like; What is it to do physics? what does it mean for us to be ‘‘right’’ in physics? What is the *purpose* of physics? Now, we have made the transition from thinking **about** physics to thinking about the *philosophy of physics*. The question is no longer ‘‘how does one do physics?’’ or ‘‘what physical theories explain this phenomena?’’. Instead, we dig deeper, asking about physics itself. Why do we do physics? how does one do physics the right way? How does one interpret physics? 

Take medicine. In medieval times, disease was an imbalance of the four ‘‘humors’’ that needed to be in balance for good health. Obviously, we don’t think of medicine that way anymore. We have a *better* framework for thinking about it. How could we have come about this framework? Perhaps we could have asked ourselves: what does it mean to have an imbalance of humors? Do we really know what that means? By forcing ourselves to clarify our thinking, we forced an improvement in medicine. Many things could force us to clarify this thinking. It could be internally prompted. Maybe we just sat down on an armchair someday and really thought about how we were doing with this whole medicine thing, and we realized we weren’t going about it the best way. It could also have been externally prompted. Perhaps, we simply noticed that the self proclaimed doctors amongst us simply weren’t doing very good of a job.  This is the *philosophy* of medicine in action.

This, the philosophy of anything is how we think about it. It deals with what it means to think about that specific things, and the best ways to think about those things, utilising careful reasoning and sound logic, wheel avoiding the common pitfalls that occur with human thinking. 

Because of this, philosophy can be assumed to exist wherever the need for sound thinking does.
