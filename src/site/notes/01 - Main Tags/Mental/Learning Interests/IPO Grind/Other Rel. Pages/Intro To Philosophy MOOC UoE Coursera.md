###### Intro
There is an interesting selection of philosophers attempting to give their own definitions of philosophy at [Philosophy Bites](http://www.philosophybites.com/) - Browseable.

For a detailed historical survey of different conceptions of philosophy have a look at [this article](http://www.iep.utm.edu/con-meta/) (bloodclat long) from the [Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/).

Both of these are excellent resources, and well worth browsing for material relevant to the rest of the course.

If you'd like to think more about the argument concerning free will, then [this](http://www.iep.utm.edu/freewill/) (bloodclat long, but less so than previous one) Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy article is a good place to start.

If you would like to read more about Hume and his work have a look at [this article](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/) (bloodclat long) from the [Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/), as well as [this article](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume/%20) (comparably bloodclat long to previous one) from the Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. Moreover, If you fancy having a go at reading some of Hume's works you can find selected texts at [this page](https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/texts) , part of Jonathan Bennett's fantastic project [Early Modern Texts](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/).

If you would like to read more about Kant and his work have a look at [this article](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/) from the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. [Selected works](https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/texts)of Kant can also be found at Early Modern Texts. Be warned, however, they can be pretty heavy going!

For a slightly more irreverent view on [Hume](http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/2010/03/29/episode-17-humes-empiricism-what-can-we-know/%20), [Kant](http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/2010/05/14/episode-19-kant-what-can-we-know/%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20), and the question ['Why do philosophy?'](http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/03/22/episode-73-why-do-philosophy-and-what-is-it/%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20) have a listen to the linked podcasts from [The Partially Examined Life](http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/%20). Warning: contains occasional strong language!

**My Plan is to go through this first module while reading through the course handout, and making notes. I will come back here after that and pick out what to read**
