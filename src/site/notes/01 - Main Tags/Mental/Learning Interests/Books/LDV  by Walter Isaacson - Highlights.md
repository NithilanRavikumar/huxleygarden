ability to combine art and science, made iconic by his drawing of a perfectly proportioned man spread-eagle inside a circle and square, known as Vitruvian Man, made him history’s most creative genius.

the ability to make connections across disciplines—arts and sciences, humanities and technology—is a key to innovation, imagination, and genius.

**Page 3**  
“He saw beauty in both art and engineering,” Jobs said, “and his ability to combine them was what made him a genius.”

---

**Page 3**  
His genius was of the type we can understand, even take lessons from. It was based on skills we can aspire to improve in ourselves, such as curiosity and intense observation. He had an imagination so excitable that it flirted with the edges of fantasy, which is also something we can try to preserve in ourselves and indulge in our children.

---

**Page 4**  
At first I thought that his susceptibility to fantasia was a failing, revealing a lack of discipline and diligence that was related to his propensity to abandon artworks and treatises unfinished. To some extent, that is true. Vision without execution is hallucination. But I also came to believe that his ability to blur the line between reality and fantasy, just like his sfumato techniques for blurring the lines of a painting, was a key to his creativity. Skill without imagination is barren. Leonardo knew how to marry observation and imagination, which made him history’s consummate innovator.

**Page 5**  
My favorite gems in his notebooks are his to-do lists, which sparkle with his curiosity. One of them, dating from the 1490s in Milan, is that day’s list of things he wants to learn.

---

**Page 5**  
The reason he wanted to know was because he was Leonardo: curious, passionate, and always filled with wonder.

a desire to marvel about the world that we encounter each day can make each moment of our lives richer.

**Page 8**  
Notoriously, he left many of his paintings unfinished, most notably the Adoration of the Magi, Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, and the Battle of Anghiari. As a result, there exist now at most fifteen paintings fully or mainly attributable to him.

**Page 9**  
ability to combine art, science, technology, the humanities, and imagination remains an enduring recipe for creativity.

---

**Page 9**  
Leonardo’s relentless curiosity and experimentation should remind us of the importance of instilling, in both ourselves and our children, not just received knowledge but a willingness to question it—to be imaginative and, like talented misfits and rebels in any era, to think different.

**Page 12**  
Because Michele was a notary, he was entitled to the honorific “Ser” and thus became known as Ser Michele da Vinci.

---

**Page 17**  
But he also took pride that his lack of formal schooling led him to be a disciple of experience and experiment. “Leonardo da Vinci, disscepolo della sperientia,”16 he once signed himself.

---

**Page 17**  
lack of reverence for authority and his willingness to challenge received wisdom would lead him to craft an empirical approach for understanding nature that foreshadowed the scientific method developed more than a century later by Bacon and Galileo. His method was rooted in experiment, curiosity, and the ability to marvel at phenomena that the rest of us rarely pause to ponder after we’ve outgrown our wonder years.

was a good time for a child with such ambitions and talents to be born.

Italy was beginning a rare forty-year period during which it was not wracked by wars among its city-states. Literacy, numeracy, and income were rising dramatically as power shifted from titled landowners to urban merchants and bankers, who benefited from advances in law, accounting, credit, and insurance. The Ottoman Turks were about to capture Constantinople, unleashing on Italy a migration of fleeing scholars with bundles of manuscripts containing the ancient wisdom of Euclid, Ptolemy, Plato, and Aristotle. Born within about a year of Leonardo were Christopher Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci, who would lead an era of exploration. And Florence, with its booming merchant class of status-seeking patrons, had become the cradle of Renaissance art and humanism.

In 1910 Freud used the kite tale as the foundation for a short book, Leonardo da Vinci and a Memory of His Childhood.21

---

**Page 19**  
Leonardo’s repressed desires, he speculated, were channeled into his feverish creativity, but he left many works unfinished because he was inhibited.

---

**Page 20**  
“Intellectual passion drives out sensuality,” he wrote in one of his notebooks.

---

**Page 20**  
“Oh time, swift despoiler of all things, how many kings, how many nations hast thou undone, and how many changes of states and of circumstances have happened since this wondrous fish perished.”

---

**Page 21**  
Leonardo da Vinci is sometimes incorrectly called “da Vinci,” as if that were his last name rather than a descriptor meaning “from Vinci.”

---

**Page 24**  
His notebooks have many other maxims praising the countryside and solitude. “Leave your family and friends and go over the mountains and valleys into the country,” he instructed aspiring painters. “While you are alone you are entirely your own master.”3 These paeans to country living are romantic and, for those who cherish the image of lonely genius, quite appealing. But they are infused with fantasy. Leonardo would spend almost all of his career in Florence, Milan, and Rome, crowded centers of creativity and commerce, usually surrounded by students, companions, and patrons.

---

**Page 24**  
Like many artists, he was stimulated by being with people of diverse interests and (willing to contradict himself in his notebooks) declared, “Drawing in company is much better than alone.”

---

**Page 26**  
“Beautiful Florence has all seven of the fundamental things a city requires for perfection,” the essayist Benedetto Dei wrote in 1472, when Leonardo was living there. “First of all, it enjoys complete liberty; second, it has a large, rich, and elegantly dressed population; third, it has a river with clear, pure water, and mills within its walls; fourth, it rules over castles, towns, lands and people; fifth, it has a university, and both Greek and accounting are taught; sixth, it has masters in every art; seventh, it has banks and business agents all over the world.”

---

**Page 26**  
In the 1430s it had been crowned with the world’s largest dome, built by the architect Filippo Brunelleschi, which was a triumph of both art and engineering, and linking those two disciplines was a key to Florence’s creativity. Many of the city’s artists were also architects, and its fabric industry had been built by combining technology, design, chemistry, and commerce.

Vitruvius’s paean to classical proportions, De Architectura.

---

**Page 29**  
After accomplishing this trick on a painted panel, Brunelleschi showed how parallel lines seemed to converge in the distance toward a vanishing point. His formulation of linear perspective transformed art and also influenced the science of optics, the craft of architecture, and the uses of Euclidean geometry.11

---

**Page 31**  
Leonardo studied his treatises and consciously tried to emulate both his writing and his demeanor. Alberti had established himself as “an avatar of grace in every word or movement,” a style that very much appealed to Leonardo. “One must apply the greatest artistry in three things,” Alberti wrote, “walking in the city, riding a horse, and speaking, for in each of these one must try to please everyone.”12 Leonardo mastered all three.

---

**Page 31**  
Alberti’s On Painting expanded on Brunelleschi’s analysis of perspective by using geometry to calculate how perspective lines from distant objects should be captured on a two-dimensional pane. He also suggested that painters hang a veil made of thin thread between themselves and the objects they are painting, then record where each element falls on the veil. His new methods improved not only painting but endeavors ranging from mapmaking to stage designs.

---

**Page 31**  
Leonardo was interested in so many things that he got easily distracted. He turned out to be good in geometry, but he never mastered the use of equations or the rudimentary algebra that existed at the time.

---

**Page 32**  
Being left-handed also affected Leonardo’s method of drawing. As with his writing, he drew from right to left so as not to smudge the lines with his hand.16 Most artists draw hatching strokes that slope upward to the right, like this: ////. But Leonardo’s hatching was distinctive because his lines started on the lower right and moved upward to the left, like this: \. Today this style has an added advantage: the left-handed hatching in a drawing is evidence that it was made by Leonardo.

---

**Page 37**  
There was harmony in proportions, Leonardo learned, and math was nature’s brushstroke.

---

**Page 41**  
Chiaroscuro, from the Italian for “light/dark,” is the use of contrasts of light and shadow as a modeling technique for achieving the illusion of plasticity and three-dimensional volume in a two-dimensional drawing or painting.

---

**Page 41**  
Leonardo also pioneered sfumato, the technique of blurring contours and edges. It is a way for artists to render objects as they appear to our eye rather than with sharp contours.

---

**Page 47**  
The glory of being an artist, he realized, was that reality should inform but not constrain.

---

**Page 55**  
This use of sfumato, the smokiness that blurs sharp contours, was by now a hallmark of Leonardo’s art.

---

**Page 55**  
Leonardo took care to observe the real world, and he noticed the opposite: when we look at three-dimensional objects, we don’t see sharp lines. “Paint so that a smoky finish can be seen, rather than contours and profiles that are distinct and crude,”

If you stand close enough to the painting at the National Gallery in Washington, DC, you can see his fingerprint just to the right of Ginevra’s jaw, where her ringlets of hair blur into the background juniper tree and a distinct little spiky sprig juts out. Another can be found just behind her right shoulder.

**Page 66**  
Unlike reflected light, which “partakes of the color of the object,” Leonardo wrote, a spot of luster “is always white,” and it moves when the viewer moves.

A boyish character, pointing toward Jesus but looking away, is in the location often used by Renaissance artists to insert a likeness of themselves. (Botticelli portrays himself in the same location in his Adoration of 1475.)

“The oyster, when the moon is full, opens itself wide, and when the crab looks in he throws in a stone or seaweed and the oyster cannot close again, whereby it serves for food to that crab. This is what happens to him who opens his mouth to tell his secret. He becomes the prey of the treacherous hearer.”

---

**Page 126**  
For example, one prophecy begins, “Many people by puffing out a breath with too much haste will thereby lose their sight and soon after all consciousness,” but then Leonardo reveals that the description refers to people “blowing out the candlelight when going to bed.”

A Florentine traveler to India recorded that the people there “do not feed on anything that has blood, nor will they allow anyone to hurt any living thing, like our Leonardo da Vinci.”

**Page 130**  
“If you are, as you have described yourself, the king of the animals,” he wrote of humans, “why do you help other animals only so that they may be able to give you their young in order to gratify your palate?” He referred to a vegetable diet as “simple” food and urged its adoption.

---

**Page 137**  
“Pleasure and Pain are represented as twins,” Leonardo wrote on the drawing, “because there never is one without the other.”

---

**Page 139**  
His notion of “vain dreams” appears to include sexual fantasies, and he went on to lament that they can distract a person from getting on with his work. “It is here that much precious time is wasted and many vain pleasures are enjoyed,” he wrote of a bed, “both by the mind in imagining impossible things and by the body in partaking of those pleasures that are often the cause of the failing of life.”

VITRUVIUS

**Page 155**  
Vitruvius, architect, writes in his work on architecture that the measurements of man are distributed in this manner: The length of the outspread arms is equal to the height of a man. From the hairline to the bottom of the chin is one-tenth of the height of a man. From below the chin to the top of the head is one-eighth of the height of a man. From above the chest to the top of the head is one-sixth of the height of a man. From above the chest to the hairline is one-seventh of the height of a man. The maximum width of the shoulders is a quarter of the height of a man. From the breasts to the top of the head is a quarter of the height of a man. From the elbow to the tip of the hand is a quarter of the height of a man. From the elbow to the armpit is one-eighth of the height of a man. The length of the hand is one-tenth of the height of a man. The root of the penis [Il membro virile] is at half the height of a man. The foot is one-seventh of the height of a man.

“My intention is to consult experience first, and then with reasoning show why such experience is bound to operate in such a way,”

The empirical method used by Bacon emphasized a cycle: observations should lead to a hypothesis, which should then be tested by precise experiments, which would then be used to refine the original hypothesis. Bacon also recorded and reported his experiments in precise detail so that others could independently replicate and verify them.

“All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk below them,” he wrote elsewhere. “All the branches of a river at every stage of its course, if they are of equal rapidity, are equal to the body of the main stream.”15 This conclusion is still known as “da Vinci’s rule,” and it has proven true in situations where the branches are not very large: the sum of the cross-sectional area of all branches above a branching point is equal to the cross-sectional area of the trunk or the branch immediately below the branching point.

---

**Page 178**  
The connections that Leonardo made across disciplines served as guides for his inquiries.

---

**Page 179**  
The acuteness of his observational skill was not some superpower he possessed. Instead, it was a product of his own effort.

---

**Page 179**  
Deep observation must be done in steps: “If you wish to have a sound knowledge of the forms of objects, begin with the details of them, and do not go on to the second step until you have the first well fixed in memory.”

“In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed, and the first of that which comes,”

**Page 184**  
No scientist before Leonardo had methodically shown how birds stay aloft. Most had simply embellished on Aristotle, who mistakenly thought that birds were supported by air the way ships were by water.12 Leonardo realized that keeping aloft in air requires fundamentally different dynamics than doing so in water, because birds are heavier than air and are thus subject to being pulled down by gravity. The first two folios of his Codex on the Flight of Birds deal with the laws of gravity, which he calls the “attraction of one object to another.” The force of gravity, he wrote, acts in the direction of “an imaginary line between the centers of each object.”13 He then described how to calculate the center of gravity of a bird, a pyramid, and other complex shapes.

---

**Page 185**  
One important observation he made ended up informing his studies of flight and of the flow of water. “Water cannot be compressed like air,” he wrote.14 In other words, a wing beating down on air will compact the air into a smaller space, and as a result the air pressure underneath the wing will be higher than the pressure of the rarefied air above it.

---

**Page 185**  
He also realized that the pressure the bird puts on the air is met by an equal and opposite pressure that the air puts on the bird. “See how the wings, striking against the air, sustain the heavy eagle in the thin air on high,” he noted, then added, “As much force is exerted by the object against the air as by the air against the object.”16 Two hundred years later, Newton would state a refined version of this as his third law of motion: “To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction.”

---

**Page 185**  
Leonardo accompanied this concept with a precursor to Galileo’s principle of relativity: “The effect of moving air on a stationary object is as great as it is when the object is moving and the air is stationary.”

---

**Page 185**  
Even more presciently, he had an intimation of what became known, more than two hundred years later, as Bernoulli’s principle: when air (or any fluid) flows faster, it exerts less pressure. Leonardo drew a cross section of a bird’s wing, which shows that the top is curved more than the underside. (This is also true of airplane wings, which make use of this principle.) The air flowing over the curved top of the wing has farther to travel than the air flowing under the bottom. Therefore, the air on top has to travel faster. The difference in speed means that the air on the top of the wing exerts less pressure than the air on the bottom, thus helping the bird (or airplane) to stay aloft.

---

**Page 186**  
a bird stays aloft not merely because the wings beat downward against the air but also because the wings propel the bird forward and the air lessens in pressure as it rushes over the wing’s curved top surface.

---

**Page 194**  
Leonardo understood the concept of what he called impetus, which is what happens when a force pushes an object and gives it momentum. “A body in motion desires to maintain its course in the line from which it started,” he wrote. “Every movement tends to maintain itself; or, rather, every body in motion continues to move so long as the influence of the force that set it in motion is maintained in it.”9 Leonardo’s insights were a precursor to what Newton, two hundred years later, would make his first law of motion: that a body in motion will stay in the same motion unless acted upon by another force.10

mathematics was the key to turning observations into theories. It was the language that nature used to write her laws. “There is no certainty in sciences where mathematics cannot be applied,”

he was more comfortable with analog tools, including the use of shapes as analogies (yes, that’s where the word analog comes from), rather than being a digital native.

One of Leonardo’s close friends at Milan’s court was Luca Pacioli, a mathematician who developed the first widely published system for double-entry bookkeeping.

“Painting is based on perspective,” he wrote, “and perspective is nothing else than a thorough knowledge of the function of the eye.”

“You must diminish the sharpness of those objects in proportion to their increasing distance from the eye of the spectator,”

Cesare Borgia was the son of the Spanish-Italian cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, soon to become Pope Alexander VI, who vies for the hotly contested title of most libertine Renaissance pope. “He had in the fullest measure all the vices of the flesh and of the spirit,” the pope’s contemporary Francesco Guicciardini wrote. He was the first pope to recognize openly his illegitimate children—ten in all, including Cesare and Lucrezia, by multiple mistresses—and he was able to get Cesare a dispensation from his illegitimacy so he could hold church offices. He made Cesare the bishop of Pamplona at fifteen and a cardinal three years later, even though the son showed less than zero predilection for piety. In fact, he had not even taken holy orders. Preferring to be a ruler rather than a religious figure, Cesare became the first person in history to fully resign from the cardinalate, and he likely had his brother stabbed to death and thrown into the Tiber so that he could replace him as the commander of the papal forces. In that capacity, he forged an alliance with the French, and he was with King Louis XII marching into Milan in 1499. The day after their arrival, they went to see The Last Supper, and there Borgia first met Leonardo. Knowing Leonardo, it is likely that during the next few weeks he showed Borgia his military engineering designs. Borgia subsequently launched a plan to carve out his own principality in the politically tumultuous Romagna region that stretched east of Florence to the Adriatic coast. These lands were supposed to be under his father, the pope, but the towns were controlled by their own independent princes, little tyrants, and vicars. Their violent rivalries regularly erupted into frenzied sieges and sackings accompanied by rampant rape and murder. By the spring of 1501, Borgia had conquered Imola, Forlì, Pesaro, Faenza, Rimini, and Cesena.2 Borgia next set his sights on Florence, which cowered in dread. Its treasury was depleted, and it had no military to defend it. In May 1501, as his forces neared Florence’s walls, the ruling Signoria of the city capitulated by agreeing to pay Borgia 36,000 florins a year as protection money and permitting his army to cross Florentine territory at will as he conquered more towns. NICCOLÒ MACHIAVELLI The bribe bought Florence peace for a year, but in June 1502 Borgia was back. As his army sacked more surrounding towns, he commanded the leaders in Florence to send a delegation to hear his latest demands. Two people were selected to try to deal with him. The elder was Francesco Soderini, a wily Church leader who led one of the anti-Medici factions in Florence. Accompanying him was the son of a bankrupt lawyer, well-educated but poor, whose writing skills and savvy understanding of power games had established him as Florence’s cleverest young diplomat: Niccolò Machiavelli. Machiavelli had a smile right out of a Leonardo painting: enigmatic, at times laconic, always appearing to hide a secret. He shared…

---

**Page 337**  
As soon as they arrived in Urbino, Soderini and Machiavelli were ushered into the ducal palace. Borgia knew how to put on a power show. He was seated in a dark room, his bearded and pockmarked face lit by a single candle. He insisted that Florence show him respect and support. Once again a vague accommodation seems to have been reached, and Borgia did not attack. A few days later, probably as part of his arrangement with Florence that Machiavelli had helped to negotiate, Borgia secured the services of the city’s most famous artist and engineer, Leonardo da Vinci.

Florence had controlled the town of Pisa, just over fifty miles down the Arno River toward the coast of the Mediterranean, for much of the fifteenth century. This was critical for Florence, which had no other outlet to the sea. But in 1494 Pisa managed to wriggle away and become a free republic. Florence’s middling army was incapable of breaching Pisa’s walls, and it could not successfully blockade the town because the Arno gave it access to supplies from the sea. Just before Pisa broke away, a major world event made Florence even more eager to control a sea outlet. In March 1493 Christopher Columbus returned safely from his first voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, and the report of his discoveries quickly spread throughout Europe. This was soon followed by a flurry of other accounts of amazing explorations. Amerigo Vespucci, whose cousin Agostino worked with Machiavelli in the Florentine chancery, helped supply Columbus’s third voyage in 1498, and the following year he made his own voyage across the Atlantic, landing in what is now Brazil. Unlike Columbus, who thought he was finding a route to India, Vespucci correctly reported to his Florentine patrons that he had “arrived at a new land which for many reasons . . . we observed to be a continent.” His correct surmise led to its being named America, after him. The excitement over what portended to be a new age of exploration made Florence’s desire to regain Pisa more urgent.

the potency of a strike diminished as the angle became more oblique. Rounded walls, rather than straight ones, were thus more likely to deflect a cannonball.

**Page 353**  
This inability to ground his fantasies in reality has generally been regarded as one of Leonardo’s major failings.

**Page 354**  
Sometimes fantasies are paths to reality.

**Page 367**  
Unlike Leonardo, Michelangelo was often contentious. He had once insulted the young artist Pietro Torrigiano, who was drawing alongside him in a Florence chapel; Torrigiano recalled “clenching my fist and giving him such a blow on the nose that I felt bone and cartilage go down like biscuit beneath my knuckles.” Michelangelo had a disfigured nose for the rest of his life. Combined with his slightly hunched back and unwashed appearance, that made him a contrast to the handsome, muscular, and stylish Leonardo.

**Page 369**  
“How could he fail to envy and detest the easy charm, the elegance, refinement, amiable sweetness of manner, dilettantism, and above all the skepticism of Leonardo, a man of another generation, said to be without religious faith, around whom there constantly strutted a crowd of beautiful pupils, led by the insufferable Salai?” wrote Serge Bramly.14

---

**Page 370**  
Florence’s leaders were then faced with the question of where to place this astonishing colossus. The issue was so contentious that there was even an outbreak of stone-throwing by some protestors. Being a republic, Florence formed a committee. Thirty or so artists and civic leaders were convened to discuss the issue, including Filippino Lippi, Perugino, Botticelli, and of course Leonardo. They gathered on January 25, 1504, in a meeting room near the Duomo, in sight of the finished statue, and considered nine locations, two of which became finalists. Michelangelo originally hoped that his statue would stand outside the entrance to the cathedral on the Piazza del Duomo, but he soon realized that it was better as a civic symbol of Florence and urged that it be placed in the piazza in front of the Palazzo della Signoria. Giuliano da Sangallo, who was one of Florence’s best architects as well as a sculptor, favored a site underneath the wide-arched Loggia della Signoria, a building on the corner of the piazza. He and his supporters made the argument that tucking the David there would best protect it from the elements, but that choice also had the effect of making it less prominent, dominant, and visible. “We will go to see it, and not have the figure come to see us,” said another supporter of the loggia location. Not surprisingly, Leonardo came down on the side of stashing it inside the portico. When it was his turn to speak, he said, “I agree that it should be in the Loggia, as Giuliano has said, but on the parapet where they hang the tapestries.” Clearly, he preferred that Michelangelo’s statue be put in an inconspicuous space.15

---

**Page 372**  
As soon as his statue of David was placed in the most prominent spot in Florence’s civic plaza, Michelangelo was commissioned to paint a battle scene that would be a companion to Leonardo’s in the great hall. To the Signoria and its leader Soderini, the decision was a conscious effort to play off the rivalry between the era’s two greatest artists. Accounts from the time all use the same word for it: concorrenza, or competition.

---

**Page 377**  
Their divergent approaches represent two schools in Florentine art: that of Leonardo, Andrea del Sarto, Raphael, Fra Bartolomeo, and others who emphasized the use of sfumato and chiaroscuro, and the more traditional approach taken by Michelangelo, Agnolo Bronzino, Alessandro Allori, and others who favored a disegno based on outlined contours.

“Though human ingenuity may make various inventions,” he wrote, “it will never devise an invention more beautiful, more simple, more direct than does Nature; because in her inventions nothing is lacking and nothing is superfluous.”

**Page 403**  
a groundbreaking experiment, he used sculpture and casting techniques to map the hollow cavities, known as cerebral ventricles, in the human brain (fig. 105). From his studies of ways to cast the great horse monument in Milan, Leonardo knew how to inject molten wax into the brain and provide ventilation holes for the air and fluids in the cavities to escape. “Make two vent-holes in the horns of the greater ventricles, and insert melted wax with a syringe, making a hole in the ventricle of memory; and through such a hole fill the three ventricles of the brain. Then when the wax has set, take apart the brain, and you will see the shape of the ventricles exactly.” A small sketch on the bottom-right of the page illustrates the technique.16 Leonardo did the experiment using the brain of a cow, since it was easier to get than a human brain. But from his readings and earlier human dissections, he knew how to modify his findings and apply them to a human brain, which he did with impressive accuracy on a set of drawings that display it in an exploded view (fig. 106).17 His only mistakes were that the middle ventricle is slightly enlarged because of the pressure of the wax, and the ends of the lateral ventricles were not completely filled by the wax. Otherwise, the results were extraordinary. Leonardo had for the first time in history injected a molding material into a human cavity. It was a technique that would not be replicated until the studies by the Dutch anatomist Frederik Ruysch more than two centuries later.
