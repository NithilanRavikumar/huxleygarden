Not good enough to be ASI, AGI or even GPT-5. OpenAI is keeping all the details closed off.
Huge gains in accuracy as compared to GPT-4 in PhD level Physics, as well as Math and Formal Logic.
Huge gains in programming capability. When allowed 50 submissions, in the 50th percentile of IOI, but broke the gold medal solution when allowed 10,000 submissions.
It’s CodeForces elo went from the 11th percentile all the way to the 93rd percentile. 
O1 thinks; it doesn’t predict. 
Produces reasoning tokens; sorta steps in the logical process; helps it optimise each step in the future, and also backtrack as necessary. sorta like steps in math. 
Response requires a lot more time, compute power, and money.
Still can’t count the r’s in strawberry though. Actual chain of thought is hidden from the end user. However, you do have to pay for these tokens at the cost of $60 per million of them. 
GPT 4 depends on knowing info, o1 can reason with very little data.
