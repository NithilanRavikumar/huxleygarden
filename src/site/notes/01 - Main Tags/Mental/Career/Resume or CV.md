## **Profile**

I read a lot of random shit which is sorta my primary skillset?  

Most of my day is spent reading, working on a paper I’m writing, and having long conversations online — I have no irl social life from moving so much (╥﹏╥).  It's fine though — DMs are way more fun, and sometimes these rich Nigerian princes hit me up.

I dropped out of my physics degree because I decided I could learn it faster. I want to learn everything. I combine deep curiosity with extensive experience from working with folks at IISc and the Cavendish Lab at Cambridge.

Now I’m back in the 'uru for the next 5–6 months with no goal (because I need a break, which is what I tell myself). Whether I’ll re-enroll in the university pipeline (at my parents' behest) or work on something insane next is TBD.

I’m creative—not in the typical, résumé-statement way, but in the truest sense possible. I have a knack for seeing connections and solutions that others might miss.

My expertise spans theoretical physics, behavioral economics, and cybersecurity, with a talent for making complex ideas accessible. This is reflected in my work helping train the Indian IJSO team, which won 5 Golds and 1 Silver during my time there.

I’m driven to understand the nature of existence and our place in the universe. I involve myself in projects and ideas that hold the most promise in pursuing that understanding. 

Over the past few months, I’ve taken a polymathic approach to learning and working, diving into a diverse array of seemingly unrelated—yet, to me, essential—skills and projects.
