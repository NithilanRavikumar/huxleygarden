# General Tips and Information I've Picked Up
Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants. — Epictetus

Everything else is secondary and lucky for us, this means we don’t need much. And by that, I mean we won’t have a lot of expenses, and we won’t need to make that much money while travelling to actually keep up this lifestyle.

Free travel doesn’t involve a millionaire giving us their fortune, free travel is integrating fulfilling travel based work into our travel routine while keeping our expenses down — and it’s the simplest, easiest, and most rewarding decision you might make at this point in your life.

Flights can be incredibly cheap, but because most people are used to travelling like holiday makers or vacationers, this becomes very expensive.

One of my favorite features of [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com.au/) or [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights), is that you can browse a particular flight by day, and at a glance, see which days are cheaper with graphs. So right now, you could punch in your city and destination and browse month by month to find the cheapest flight.

Another cool feature is that you can type in your city and select “everywhere” and then get a whole list of countries you can get to on the cheap. Perfect if you’re not sure about where to go.

Resource List — Some other great sites and apps

- [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) — Fantastic for land based travel. It’ll give you buses and trains through popular routes (great for Europe and South America). It also gives you flights but I’d recommend Google Flights or Skyscanner for better results in that domain.
- [12Go Asia](https://12go.asia/en) — Much like Rome2Rio, this is one of the better agencies for land and sea based transport but as the name suggests, it’s for Asia. Very useful, especially for night trains and buses.
- [Scott’s Cheap Flights](https://scottscheapflights.com/) — An email newsletter that sends great finds to your inbox. They have a free and premium version. You’ll get some great little finds, even with the free version.

Hot Tip #1: When it comes to flying, having a specific email just to subscribe to airlines’ lists is great. With budget airlines especially, there can be obscenely cheap international flights

Hot Tip #2: If you have a credit card, or you’re looking to get/change one, there are a lot of them that give you the same interest rate and interest free period, but will also bundle in points towards air fares. Especially if you have regular expenses like rent, these points add up quickly and you can be sure to get free flights from it.

If you’re bouncing around from place to place, you need to travel with the bare minimum. And I’m talking only carry on. You can save an incredible amount of money by not checking in your bags. And it’s 100% doable.

The dimensions for carry-on allowances for most airlines is 56cm x 36cm x 23cm or 22" x 14" x 9".

This definitely varies but not to the extent you should be worried about unless it’s some budget European airlines like [Ryanair](https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en/useful-info/baggage/bag-policy) who use quite a few predatory strategies to get as much money out of you as possible.

Again, most airlines will have similar dimensions, and as for weight, it’s usually a 7kg a bag.

1. Take one pair of shoes, and flips flops. Get shoes [like these](https://www.nike.com/au/t/air-zoom-pegasus-35-running-shoe-kX9NZL/942851-007) that you can use for almost anything.Get them all black, dress them up and down, go for a run or workout, light trekking even.
2. Don’t pack things you can buy/find at your destination. Don’t bring tubs of sunscreen, toothpaste, a hairdryer etc. You can find almost anything abroad and won’t need that stuff to weigh you down.
3. Your laptop and small camera don’t count most of the time. If you travel with these, a lot of airlines won’t count them in your carry on if they’re in your hands as you walk aboard.
4. [These bags](https://www.google.com/search?q=travel+compartments&sxsrf=ACYBGNSfBxIFDv0VKem1lmTt4-1N-lFALA%3A1575895936643&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiVvIbszajmAhW8_XMBHcfrC5kQ_AUoAnoECA8QBA&biw=1280&bih=587) will help you organize your life. Make sure you get ones that are breathable for when you’ve got damp clothes.
5. A travel neck pillow, travel towel, fold-able backpack and earplugs are some of smaller but life saving items in your kit.

Here are best websites and apps to find cheap accommodation.

- [Booking](https://www.booking.com/)
- [Hostelworld](https://www.hostelworld.com/)
- [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com/)
- [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)

The best way to get the accommodation you want at the price you want is to basically use these sites as a catalog, find something you like, and go into the establishment without booking and book direct with the hostel.

Most of the time, they won’t charge the fee that the middlemen charge, and you’ll get a better deal. If it happens to be the same or more, just book right then and there on the app instead.

Hostels

South East Asia — $5 to $15 per night

Eastern Europe — $7 to $15 per night

Western Europe — $25+ per night

(Prices in USD)

Dorm style rooms ranging from 4 person to 8 person regularly, and sometimes crazy amounts where it’s 20+ in one large room. Don’t let that scare you, in fact, especially in South East Asia the hostels are absolutely beautiful.

The beds are comfortable and clean, the facilities are modern, the atmosphere is fantastic, and you have a whole ‘share house’ feel with a bunch of other backpackers that are on a similar journey to you. Hostelworld is my go-to to discover hostels that have a great atmosphere.

It can get loud depending on the type of hostel you’re staying in so definitely check whether you’re at a party hostel, or a more relaxed one.

If you’re looking for the more cultural experience, there are a number of families in each town that offer up a room in their home. You get to live, eat, and spend time with the locals instead of other backpackers.

Sometimes paying a bit extra at these home-stays is worth enjoying real local cuisine and having a room to yourself, although it can also be a dorm as well.

One thing to consider is that some hostels/hotels will put home-stay in the name, so if you’re looking to find an actual home-stay with a family and such, you need to look a bit harder. Searching for host families or going through recommendations is your best bet.

Yes you can absolutely stay in places for free. Here are some platforms and methods that let you do just that.

[Couchsurfing.com](https://www.couchsurfing.com/) — People list their couch, spare rooms, air mattresses, and beds on here for travelers to crash. You can set up a profile easily and create an interesting bio so your potential host is happy to accept you.

People list their rooms here for multiple different reasons. They may have traveled before and want to meet more backpackers, they may be proud of their town and want to show people around.

Just be aware, and look at reviews. Although it’s very safe, I’ve known instances where some guys set this up and use it in place of Tinder… They accept female travelers and hit on them throughout the duration of their stay

House or Dog Sitting — There are several services that let you sign up for a fee, or even free and this lets you mind people’s houses aka. live there while they’re away for free.

There are a few that are quite good and worldwide at that.

- [Trusted House Sitters](https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/)
- [House Carers](https://www.housecarers.com/)
- [Mind My House](https://www.mindmyhouse.com/)

The pros to this are that with a small fee, you get almost unlimited accommodation. You get to stay in large houses/apartments, most likely with stocked fridges that the host is more than happy to let you demolish.

The cons are that before you build up your profile and become more trusted with some of these, you might not get your pick of litter. You don’t have unlimited options e.g. wanting to go to Ibiza and stay there for free might not be in the cards, but there might be a place just outside of Naples. So for the fluid traveler, this isn’t a big deal, but if you’re looking for a certain place then you might want to leave this for another time.

Working in Hostels — This is my favorite. No matter which hostel you’re in, you’ll always find a ‘volunteer.’ Volunteers usually stay for free, eat for free and get a weekly allowance at the hostel for a few hours of work every day.

This isn’t income replacing stuff, but the fact that this offers you a chance to really explore a town/city, have a small social circle, and the ability to meet new people and socialize day in day out is an absolute win for so many backpackers.

How do you become a hostel volunteer? Are you good with people, speak English, and are around for a while? If the answer is yes, the hostel you’re in will most likely hire you. For hostels it’s a great deal, they get almost free labor while you get free board and more. It’s a win win

All you have to do is ask. If they don’t have an opening, one of the other hundred hostels in the area likely do.

[https://www.worldpackers.com/](https://www.worldpackers.com/) - Seems very cool. Very flexible options available, for sure check out. Similar is Workaway. - Buncha travel channels have codes for discounts.

[https://gostops.com/](https://gostops.com/) - Interesting (for whithin India)

Camping — Not so much for South East Asia, but for Europe there are a number countries like Scotland and Poland that have free pitching i.e. you can legally pitch your tent pretty much anywhere without paying anything. This is good news, especially if you like camping.

There are amazing spots all around Europe where it’s not only cheaper to camp, but it’s an amazing experience in itself that might warrant further research if you’re interested.

This is your Hot Tip #1 for every major city during your travels when it comes to saving money: Get out of the city center.

Everything in the city center for most developed cities caters to business people and tourists. The prices are high and although the quality might be there, you can absolutely do better.

This is almost always a given in terms of food and fun.

Hot Tip #2 — Cook your own food in expensive cities.

Another thing to keep in mind while trying to keep food expenses down is that in expensive cities like Paris or Amsterdam, the food prices can be high enough that it’s worth cooking your own food.

Before booking accommodation, check if they have kitchen facilities, and a top tip here is to check pictures to make sure it’s an actual kitchen rather than a microwave in the corner.

You’re travelling so you definitely want to try the local cuisine in a lot of places, so don’t restrict yourself by cooking all the time to save money. However, especially in western Europe, if you’re able to keep it light for a meal or 2. Say breakfast and a pre-lunch snack, you can save a lot for more exciting meals.

In South East Asia, it doesn’t matter as much as the street food, market food and general restaurants are quite cheap. Speaking of which…

Hot Tip #3 — Street food vendors & food markets will have some of the cheapest and most delicious food you’ll eat.

Local street vendors are even cheaper. A good indication of whether the place is worth it, is whether there are locals there, and if an English menu exists. Because if the answer is yes and no respectively, you’re in for a treat.

When you’re on your solo backpacking trip, you’re obviously going to be spending money. A lot of the places you’ll visit will be cash based markets where the default exchange is in cash rather than card. So you’ll need to carry the local currency.

Depending on a number of factors, you have a few options on how you could approach changing currency.

Carry a sizable quantity US Dollars — No matter where you go, you best bet they’ll accept US Dollars at a currency exchange booth. And yes they’ll accept other currencies like Euro and Pound but the US Dollar will get you a better rate in almost every situation.

The US Dollar is perceived as less volatile and it can be sold quite easily versus for instance the Australian dollar, which can be sold easy enough but not quite to the extent of the USD.

Pros

- Better exchange rates vs your bank at home
- No ATM fees

Cons

- Theft risk for carrying large amounts of cash

Get a travel debit card — Your bank likely has a travel card option where you can load up your local currency and use it at ATM’s around the world to take out their local currency.

This lets you keep your money safe in your account but the downside is that the exchange rates can sometimes be sub par, there can be ATM fees, and other fees on top of that. So you need to do your research before getting one.

A lot of these negatives can be offset if you get the right card by doing some research. There are cards out there that don’t charge withdrawal or reloading fees, and they use relatively tame exchange rates. Some even refund you any fees that the foreign ATM’s might charge (ING does this for Australia).

The easiest way to search this is by typing “[bank name] travel card” in Google. You’ll come across multiple review sites but definitely read the rules on their official sites before committing. Having backup cards is also great.

By far the most common ways to earn while traveling are as follows;

1. Teach English, German, French or Spanish
2. Work/Volunteer in hostels and guesthouses
3. Teach Yoga or run fitness classes
4. Be a tour guide for a certain city
5. Work remotely doing multiple disciplines (skilled and unskilled)

You might even be able to pick up work in the services industry regardless of experience, but if you do have experience, you’ll have quite a few options available.

- Waiting tables
- Cooking food
- Manning a bar
- Making coffee

This option isn’t only for backpacking. If you’re looking to really spend time in a single country, many countries in Asia run private and government programs where you can teach English on a contract.

Japan is a prime example of this with their [JET Programme](http://jetprogramme.org/en/eligibility/). This program places you in a school and you work with the English teacher to teach classes. They pay for your living expenses, set you up with utilities and pay you a decent salary.

If you’re thinking, “hey that’s not a bad deal.” Then you’re in for a treat because a lot of these English teaching jobs are quite lucrative in terms of benefits.

The criteria for acceptance is usually being a Native English speaker and having a bachelors degree. A lot of the time, especially in instances that you don’t have a bachelors degree, a TEFL or TEFOL certificate is necessary, which you can easily get, in fact, a lot of the jobs on offer provide it for you.

[Gooverseas.com](https://www.gooverseas.com/teaching-jobs-abroad) is your friend here. The link right there is a key resource in finding teaching jobs all over the world.

You can find jobs that involve

- Online teaching that’s hourly
- Salaried ‘in person’ positions ranging from $1500-$3500 a month
- Private tutoring
- Kindergarten classes or adult classes

When it comes to a TEFL or TEFOL certificate, it involves 120 hours of training, and shouldn’t be mistaken as a private/government certification body, they’re just acronyms. There are many institutions and sites that you can get them from. This blog has a list of their [Top 10 certifying bodies.](https://www.goabroad.com/articles/tefl-courses/best-places-get-tefl-certified-worldwide-2018)

Don’t bother looking into a visa if you’re going for one of these positions, the online application and confirmation usually comes with a visa that the hiring body will pay for.

Find jobs by simply asking local businesses if they needed a hand. Now they earn enough where they can stay in places for months at a time really, enjoying the scenery and cuisine, meeting the people, and getting to know the area.

This works best in places that have these characteristics

- Sizable tourism hot spots
- During peak season — requiring more hands on deck
- Growing hubs with lots of new businesses

Hot Tip #1: Most countries require you to have a working visa to earn money there, and this is fine if you’re going longer term, but if you’re traveling with a tourist visa or a visa exemption, the common loophole is “volunteering” — this is why hostels give you board, food and an allowance (over a wage).

Hot Tip #2: In Asia and South America especially, a lot of businesses will hire you off the books. And a lot of their business is conducted off the books for that matter. There might not even be a loophole for this behavior, but a lot of people do it and get way with it. Do so at your own risk as you could potentially get a hefty fine.

If you’re looking for a longer term cultural experience, and you’re not going to be as mobile, [Workaway](https://www.workaway.info/) is a great resource to set you up with a host where you’ll be helping out local businesses, NGO’s, farms and more.

It’s currently the wild west days of taking your laptop and working a few hours a day while traveling or backpacking. If you’re a journalist, coder, blogger, graphic designer, Youtuber, teacher or a slew of other disciplines — you can make money on the go with little to no worries.

most of the world doesn’t have a handle on the tax implications and policing of where this work happens. For all anyone knows, you’re just another tourist on their laptop.

The top resource for finding the perfect places to base yourself out of for a couple of months at a time is [Nomadlist](https://nomadlist.com/).

Conclusion-:

- You don’t need a lot of money to travel
- There are plenty of ways to save money and earn money while traveling
- Preparation is key when heading off on a solo backpacking journey (travel gear, flights, accommodation plans/arrangements, credit cards)
- There’s no right or wrong way to travel, you can stay in places for a few days or a few months at a time
- The collective knowledge of travelers should always be the go-to resource for your journey

There are some other Medium articles, read those. [https://wwoof.net/](https://wwoof.net/) is another great option I found, and there are many life this, so read the articles after college, and figure it out.
