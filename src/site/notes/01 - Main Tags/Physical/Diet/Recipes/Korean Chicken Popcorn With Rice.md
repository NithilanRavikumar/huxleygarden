### Instructions:

#### 1. **Prepare the Chicken**:

1. Dice the chicken breast into bite-sized cubes.
2. In a bowl, combine the chicken cubes, soy sauce, and 1 egg. Mix well using your hands to coat the chicken thoroughly.
3. In a large container with a lid, add corn starch. Using your hands or a strainer, transfer the chicken into the container. Close the lid and shake well until all the chicken pieces are evenly coated with the corn starch.
4. Place the coated chicken pieces individually on a wire rack and spray them with cooking spray.
5. **Baking**: Preheat your oven to 220°C and bake the chicken for 15-18 minutes until golden brown.  
    **Air-frying**: Air-fry the chicken at 200°C for 10-12 minutes, or until crispy and golden.

#### 2. **Make the Korean Glaze**:

1. In a large skillet or saucepan, bring the following ingredients to a boil: soy sauce, water, ketchup, gochujang, rice vinegar, honey, and brown stevia or low-calorie sugar.
2. Stir frequently and let the sauce cook until it thickens slightly (about 5-7 minutes).
3. Once the sauce is thick, add the cooked chicken and toss to coat all the pieces evenly.

#### 3. **Prepare the Sticky Rice**:

1. Cook 150 g of short-grain rice according to the package instructions (or in a rice cooker).
2. Once the rice is cooked, allow it to cool for about 10 minutes.
3. In a small bowl, mix 45 ml rice vinegar, 1 tablespoon of sweetener, and salt to taste.
4. Add this mixture to the cooled rice and mix well to create sweet and sticky rice.

#### 4. **Assemble and Serve**:

1. Divide the popcorn chicken into four equal servings and do the same for the sticky rice.
2. Garnish the chicken with chopped chives and sesame seeds.
3. Serve and enjoy your high-protein Korean popcorn chicken meal!
