### Ingredients:

- 1/4 cup Frank's RedHot sauce
- 2 tablespoons Gochujang (Korean chili paste) – for the authentic sweet-spicy kick
- 3 tablespoons honey or brown sugar – for sweetness
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce – for umami
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar – for tanginess
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ginger, grated
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil – for a nutty flavor
- 1/4 cup ketchup – for thickness and extra tang
- Toasted sesame seeds and chopped green onions (for garnish)

### Instructions:

1. Combine the Ingredients: In a small saucepan, combine Frank's RedHot, gochujang, honey or brown sugar, soy sauce, rice vinegar, minced garlic, grated ginger, sesame oil, and ketchup.
2. Simmer the Sauce: Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Stir continuously to dissolve the sugar and blend the ingredients.
3. Thicken the Sauce: Let the sauce simmer for about 5-7 minutes, or until it thickens to your desired consistency. Be sure to stir frequently to prevent burning.
4. Coat the Chicken: Once the sauce is ready, remove it from heat and let it cool slightly. Toss your cooked chicken (preferably fried or baked until crispy) in the sauce until well coated.
5. Garnish and Serve: Transfer the coated chicken to a plate and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and chopped green onions.

### Tips:

- Adjust the Sweetness and Heat: Feel free to modify the ratio of honey, sugar, or gochujang to suit your taste.
- Make It Stickier: If you want a thicker, stickier sauce, cook it a bit longer or add a teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with a little water to help it thicken.
