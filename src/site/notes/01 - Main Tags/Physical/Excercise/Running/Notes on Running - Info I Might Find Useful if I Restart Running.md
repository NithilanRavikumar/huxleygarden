I can't run. This reality hit me within the first 10 minutes of an ambitious 15k I attempted last week. I expected to pick up where I left running last year, maybe I would need to push a bit more. I wasn't prepared to be completely out of breath 5% through the run. I then sort of started avoiding restarting my running progress, because my ego didn't allow me to; it was humiliating running at barely jogging pace when I used to sprint the same distances a few months back. However, a recent burst of inspiration has hit me. While your running base should be built on time-based runs, and not distance based runs (where you run for x amount of time with good form at a pace that allows you to hold a conversation, not feeling out of breath, or any sort of strain. This could be 75 - 85 percentage of your total efforts), you should also be logging the distance ran. Adding this up for your weekly distance is important. It allows you to stay consistent in your training when designing the following week's total distance ran (for example Long runs once a week range from 20-35% of your weekly distance). It is a good number to follow to make sure you don’t overtrain by comparing week to week. It also helps when you need to increase the total distance ran in order to improve.

Long runs (L Run):

- By definition these are your runs that take over and hour to complete and should be around 25-30% of your weekly mileage.
- These can last up to 2.5 hours (going longer, according to Coach Jack Daniels does not give you any benefit in training, once again showing evidence of running for time not distance)
- These runs should be done once a week and get progressively longer until it peaks in the 3rd phase/quarter of training.
- A good rule of thumb is to add about 5min to the long run every week or two until you get to the time/distance you want.

I plan to train Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Tuesdays in terms of running. Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday will be weights. Generally, my long run would be Sunday.

*Friday, 6/6/24* - 40 minute slow run

*Saturday, 7/6/24* - 40 minute slow run with bits of walking in between. I worked up a sweat, so I'm happy with that, regardless of pace, splits, or distance.

*Thursday, 10/10/24* - It’s been a while, eh? I forgot this page existed. I went running three days this month! Yesterday was my latest, I think I did 3k at a 7:35 pace? Very slow, legs fatigue easily. However, asthma did not kill me, which I will take happily. Updates to come, now that I remembered you.
